Frontend challenge for Yolo group/Hub88

## Versions used to run the app:
node: v20.12.0
npm: 10.5.0

Other versions might also work, but I recommend running with these

## How to run
Simply run `npm i` to install the dependencies and afterwards `npm start` to run the application.
You should have port 3000 available.
